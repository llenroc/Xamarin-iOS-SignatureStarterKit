Xamarin-iOS-SignatureStarterKit
===============================
This project is meant as a starting point for anyone that wants to add signature functionality to their Xamarin.iOS app.

It’s a bit more than just a view that captures a signature as in addition to capturing a signature this project also displays a pdf and merges the signature with the pdf. Putting it all together is actually a littler tricker than it seems and that’s why I’ve created this project.

Here’s some screenshots.
